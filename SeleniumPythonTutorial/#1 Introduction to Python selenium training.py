# That was just an introduction, author talked about main topics of the course
# How I will go throw it - I will stay for some principals
# 1 - I will make conspects on Russian language in my paper copybook for EACH lesson
# 2 - Also for each lesson I will create a python file, where i will store exercises and code from the lesson
# 4 - This project will be placed on my gitHub account as a confirmation of my self-development ability and show my
# efforts and skills to people who I will work with in future
# 5 - Conspects for each lesson will be pictured/scanned and uploaded to this repository.

# * Need to notice that i learned python before, but it was not systematic
